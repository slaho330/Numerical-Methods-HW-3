**Output is the number of steps and then the method, 
followed by the runtime for one nstep of the algorithm**

The program implements iterative methods for the 3D heat
equation.  Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and S.O.Relaxation are 
implemented constant boundary conditions and a cubic shape.

There are initialize, Jacobi, GaussSeidel, and SORelax
subroutines included in the program.
